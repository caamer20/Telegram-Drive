##  What is Telegram Drive?

Telegram Drive leverages the Telegram API to allow you to upload, organize, and manage files directly on Telegram's servers. It treats your "Saved Messages" and created Channels as folders, giving you a familiar file explorer interface for your Telegram cloud.

###  Key Features

*   **Unlimited Cloud Storage**: Utilizing Telegram's generous cloud infrastructure.
*   **High Performance Grid**: Virtual scrolling handles folders with thousands of files instantly.
*   **Auto-Updates**: Seamless updates for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
*   **Media Streaming**: Stream video and audio files directly without downloading.
*   **PDF Viewer:** Built-in PDF support with infinite scrolling for seamless document reading.
*   **Drag & Drop**: Intuitive drag-and-drop upload and file management.
*   **Thumbnail Previews**: Inline thumbnails for images and media files.
*   **Folder Management**: Create "Folders" (private Telegram Channels) to organize content.
*   **Optional Encrypted Vault**: Store files in an end-to-end encrypted vault backed by a private Telegram channel.
*   **Privacy Focused**: API keys and data stay local. No third-party servers.
*   **Cross-Platform**: Native apps for macOS (Intel/ARM), Windows, and Linux.

###  Encrypted Vault Mode

Telegram Drive can also run in **Encrypted Vault** mode. After logging in, you can choose between the normal Saved Messages drive and a local-password-protected vault.

Vault files are encrypted on your device before upload using a key derived from your vault password. Telegram only receives encrypted vault blobs and encrypted manifest snapshots, stored in a private channel named `TelegramVault`. File names, folder records, and file contents are kept inside the encrypted vault manifest instead of being stored as normal Telegram channel folders.

Normal Drive remains the default path and keeps the existing Saved Messages/channel behavior unchanged. The first Vault Mode version stores vault configuration locally on the device where the vault was created, so fresh-device vault restore/import is not yet included. Keep your vault password safe; it is required to unlock encrypted files and cannot be recovered by the app.
